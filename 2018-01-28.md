# 0x01 Clickjacking

X-Frame-Options 
SAMEORIGIN:allow only pages from the same origin to embed it; 
DENY:prevent embedding entirely. This will prevent clickjacking attacks in all modern web browsers.

On top of that, you can also set up a Content Security Policy with a frame-ancestors directive pointing to white-listed hosts in order to prevent clickjacking. For example, a Content Security Policy containing frame-ancestors: none, prevents embedding the page altogether.
