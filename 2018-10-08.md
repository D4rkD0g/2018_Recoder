[msrc](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8591)

A local user can run a specially crafted application that instantiates a DCOM class and exploits a parameter handling bug in Windows IME to execute arbitrary code on the target system with elevated privileges.

The DCOM server is a Windows component installed regardless of which languages/IMEs are enabled. An attacker can instantiate the DCOM class and exploit the system even if IME is not enabled.

To exploit this vulnerability, a locally authenticated attacker could run a specially crafted application.The security update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Windows IME handles parameters in a method of a DCOM class.

#### 2. CVE-2016-7221

The Windows Input Method Editor (IME) does not properly handle DLL loading. A local user can run a specially crafted application to gain elevated privileges on the target system.

#### 3. CVE-2013-3859

[cvedetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-3859/)

The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if a logged on attacker launches Internet Explorer from the toolbar in Microsoft Pinyin IME for Simplified Chinese. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. 

#### 4. CVE-2000-0933

Input Method Editors (IMEs) enable character-based languages such as Chinese to be entered via a standard 101-key keyboard. When an IME is installed as part of the system setup, it is available by default as part of the logon screen. In such a case, the IME should recognize that it is running in the context of the LocalSystem and not in the context of a user, and restrict certain functions. However, the IME for Simplified Chinese does not correctly recognize the machine state, and exposes inappropriate functions as part of the logon screen. As a result, a malicious user who had access to either a physical keyboard or a terminal server session on an affected machine could gain LocalSystem privilege even without logging onto the machine.

#### 5. CVE-2011-2010

does not properly restrict access to configuration options, which allows local users to gain privileges via the Microsoft Pinyin (aka MSPY) IME toolbar, aka "Pinyin IME Elevation Vulnerability."	

#### 6. CVE-2006-0008

The ShellAbout API call in Korean Input Method Editor (IME) in Korean versions of Microsoft Windows XP SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2003 up to SP1, and Office 2003, allows local users to gain privileges by launching the "shell about dialog box" and clicking the "End-User License Agreement" link, which executes Notepad with the privileges of the program that displays the about box.	

#### 7. CVE-2017-7752

[bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359547)

A use-after-free memory error may occur during specific user interactions with the input method editor (IME).
